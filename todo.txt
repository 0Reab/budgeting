# features to implement - ordered

- improve logging, messages not specific enough
- change date() to actual receipt date
- refactor god awful upload() in app.py - too much going on in on func
- complete duplicate entry check and reject insertion.
- uploaded image duplicate detection and rejection - checksum?
- tests for all functions - gotta do em
- later in project - raise test exceptions after all tests run rather than immediate stop
- Move categories into a json configuration - hardcoded currently
- Data display and visualization - charts and plots

# make documentation
- proper readme
- requirements.txt

# security
- proper pentest after all is completed - sqli, rce, lfi, xss...
- change to WSGI server
